export make_continuous!

"""
`make_continuous!(vals,mod)` assumes that the list of numbers in `vals`
should represent a continuous stream of numbers, but with ambiguity modulo `mod`.
For example, they are the angles of a continuous list of complex values, but there
is an ambiguity modulo 2Ï€. This function adjusts the values so they
appear continuous.

For finer control, use `make_continuous!(vals,mod,thresh)` where `thresh` is
the maximum allowable difference between consecutive entries in `val`.
